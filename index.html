        <h1>Welcome to Nathan's CSD120 Website</h1>
            <p> Hello, and welcome to my first ever web page. My name is Nathan Foglia. I am a new computer programmer<br>
            and I am eager to learn everthing I can about programming in my short time here at sault college. I am<br>
            24 years old, taking the Computer Programming course at Sault College.<Br>
            
            When I am not at school I am either spending time with family and friends, or working. I work for a company<br>
            by the name of MicroAge. Here I work on computers of all kinds and go along with our computer networker<br>
            whenever possible. This is so I can learn more about how softwear works and how to control a server.
